# Fully Customizably Twitter Widget

Recently I needed to expose twitter feed for specific tag, in a very specifc styling and on top of that use a complex responsive layout. 
Problem was, that original twitter widget is does not allow us to customize widget design the way we want, therefore I spent some time googling and found a better solution - using Twitter Post Fetcher by [jasonmayes](https://github.com/nerijusgood/ "jasonmayes") I got what I was looking for - feed in a simple html markup.


Codepen [demo](http://codepen.io/nerijusgood/pen/Ggqygo "codepen twitter widget design") and here is a [tutorial how to customize twitter widget](https://www.nerijusgood.com/coding/customize-twitter-widget-css-markup/ "twitter widget css markup")..

Hope you like it. Don't forget to fallow me [@nerijusgood](https://twitter.com/nerijusgood "nerijusgood twitter")
